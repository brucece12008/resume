        <h2>Autobiography</h2>

        <p>
          Bruce Boateng Yeboah was born to the union of Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Kumi
          Yeboah in Tubmanburg, Bomi County. He is the last of eight children -five
          sisters and two brothers. During his early years, he developed the desire
          for writing poems and short stories, some of which were read during high
          school graduation ceremonies. As he embarked upon his middle school
          educational journey, he received double promotion with the opportunity
          to skip a class given his performance. However, his dad, who was then a
          professor, requested that the decision to double promote him be reversed
          as he would love his son to experience every grade level in his educational journey.

          While enrolled at <a href="http://www.ricksonline.org"  target="_blank">Ricks Institute</a> boarding school in Virginia, Liberia, our
          honoree  was elected president of the press club and oversaw the publication
          and presentation of newsletters and daily news, respectively. He was awarded the
          <a href="https://jjref.org" target="_blank">Joseph Jenkins Roberts’ merit-based scholarship</a> which is in honor of the first
          president of Liberia. As a beneficiary of the scholarship, a GPA of 3.5 and
          above was required to maintain the scholarship. He maintained the scholarship
          until his graduation from the University of Liberia. He graduated from Ricks
          Institute as the Valedictorian of the Ambassadors’ Class of 2006 and graduated
          from the University of Liberia with cum laude in 2011, with a Bachelor of
          Science degree in Economics. Sadly, he endured many challenges and heartache
          during these times as in 2005, he experienced the loss of his mother who wasn’t
          around to witness these accomplishments.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the desire to serve and give back to the community, our honoree, along
          with his colleagues, established a non-profit organization while enrolled at
          the University of Liberia called Young People Against Poverty and Crimes, Inc. (YOPAC).
          This organization impacted the lives of many youths in post-war Liberia, including orphans
          in the rural parts of Liberia. YOPAC’s programs encompassed the provision of scholarship
          opportunities, school supplies, workshops and the implementation of a mentorship program
          which aided in reintegrating gravely traumatized youths in the Liberian society. Following
          his stay in the US, he also established an extension of that organization here currently
          known as Youth Against Poverty and Crimes, Inc. which has a 501 (C)(3) tax-exempt status
          granted by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank">Internal Revenue Service</a>. The mission of this organization is to address
          the need for safe and better communities, and to seek the empowerment of youths, women and
          the elderly through the implementation of various socio-economic programs, with the hope
          of mitigating poverty and violent crimes in low income communities in and around New York
          City with an extension in Liberia. His passion to serve and learn still remains as these
          attributes are an embodiment of his everyday life.
